# Deepfake Image detection

We have used images from https://www.kaggle.com/xhlulu/140k-real-and-fake-faces . We have used Densenet 121 and Densenet 169.

Steps:
* Download the images
* Using ImageDataGenerator flip and rotate images (train and validation)
* Build the model (Densenet121 or Densenet169).
* Train the model
* Testing
